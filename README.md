Bwl.Graphics3D.DrawingCatsDemo
========================


Demo for CatRender (fully managed VB.NET 3D realtime render
, can be found in separate repository).

Igor Koshelev (igor@lifemotion.ru), 2008 (mainly), 2009-2014 (small fixes).

Contains ready-to-run binaries (on Windows). Simply use run.cmd to start demo.

Contains two scenes, night road and shore.
Use WASD to move, and arrow to see around.
Use F near TV to see second scene.

Demonstrates basic 3D with textring, light and shadows, fog, sprites, moving and color light sources, post-processing, script control, rain, water and other.

Source code, scripts and x files (except Cube and Cake) created by me from scratch and licenced with Apache licence. Use it as you wish.

Shore scene music (Still Alive) was taken from great Valve game Portal only as tribute for it. Rights for this song owned by Valve. Some images (Companion Cube and Cake) also was taken from that game, but modelled and textured by me from scratch.
